## Project Desription - Overview

This project aims to develop a predictive model for assessing the risk of cardiovascular diseases in individuals based on their health attributes. Cardiovascular diseases are a leading cause of mortality worldwide, and early detection and risk assessment can lead to timely interventions and improved healthcare outcomes. We utilize machine learning techniques to analyze medical data and predict the likelihood of an individual developing cardiovascular diseases, providing valuable insights for healthcare professionals and patients.
